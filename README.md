## Trying to have fun mixing React(:see_no_evil:) with Rails(:speak_no_evil:)... Coding a simple postings application

### :scroll: Content

This repository stores the resulting React front-end part of a 1-day mini-project proposed on week #19 of the "Developer" curriculum, a 3-month web coding bootcamp offered by The Hacking Project (THP, [https://www.thehackingproject.org/](https://www.thehackingproject.org/)).  
This project consists in instantiating, configuring and coding a 2 parts posting / blogging application using Rails as the back-end API for all CRUD matters and React as the related front, then linking both in a seamless full-stack web page.

### :bulb: How to

_:warning: Remember this repo has to be coupled with its sibling "THP_W19D2_Rails"_

1. Clone the current :octocat: repository to your local :computer: using something as simple as `git clone <my_local_react_folder>` (or "." for your local current directory)
2. Move to the just-brought-in directory
3. First make sure to install all dependencies / Node modules via the `npm install` command
4. Do the compiling of the different React files as well as launch the Node web server by typing `npm start` (it should warn you port 3000 being used, it'll connect to the alternate 3001)
5. Wait... Wait again... Yes, I know, it is soooo long and sloooow :snail: :turtle: :panda_face:
6. Still waiting? Congratulations! You should now see all builds passed and be able to browse [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
7. You can finally relax and - hopefully :sweat: - have fun surfing :surfer: and exploring :eyes: this _Railsful Reactwesome_ blog!
